"gas sensors for raspberry pi and pico" 
This project uses a raspberry pico to drive a GPS module, a SDS011 PM25 PM10 sensor, a SDC41 co2 sensor, a grove multi gas sensor version 2, a gravity ozone sensor, bme280, a sdcard, and a ssd1306 oled display. The goal is to take CO, CO2, VOC, C2H5OH, NO2, O3, PM25, PM10, measurement with mobility provided by GPS. The data are automatically saved in sd card. 
Some of the python codes were migrated from codes (xxx_pi.py) for raspberry pi python, or c++.
